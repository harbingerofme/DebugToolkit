## DebugToolkit

This mod adds various debugging commands to the console. See below for all commands plus explanation.

[Harb](https://thunderstore.io/package/Harb/), [iDeathHD](https://thunderstore.io/package/xiaoxiao921/) and ['s](https://thunderstore.io/package/paddywan/) reimplementation of [Morris1927's](https://thunderstore.io/package/Morris1927/) [RoR2Cheats](https://thunderstore.io/package/Morris1927/RoR2Cheats/). Derived with permission. 

Also adds autocompletion for arguments and networked commands giving their information to the right people to the console.

Track update progress, get support and suggest new features over at the [DebugToolkit discord](https://discord.gg/yTfsMWP).

Some vanilla console functions you might not know:

* The console can be opened with `ctrl+alt+~`.
* `help {command}` may be used to get help for a specific command
* `find {term}` can be used to find commands with that term.
* `max_messages {nr}` changes how much scroll back the console has. We auto change this to 100 for you if it's on default.

Mods recommended for combined use:

* [KeyBindForConsole](https://thunderstore.io/package/kristiansja/KeyBindForConsole/) for easier enabling of the console. Especially useful for non-US keyboard layouts.
* [R2DSE](https://thunderstore.io/package/Harb/R2DSEssentials/) for running DT on dedicated servers.
* [MidRunArtifacts](https://thunderstore.io/package/KingEnderBrine/MidRunArtifacts/) for enabling and disabling artifacts during a run.

You may contact us at any time through [issues on GitHub](https://github.com/harbingerofme/DebugToolkit/issues/new/choose), the [dedicated discord server](https://discord.gg/yTfsMWP) or through the [Risk of Rain 2 modding Discord](https://discord.gg/5MbXZvd) found at the top of the Thunderstore website.

## COMMANDS ##

Verbiage:
- The brackets encapsulating arguments mean `{needed}`, `(choose one)`, and `[optional]`.
- If an optional argument has a default value, it will be indicated with `:`. Any preceeding optional arguments from the one entered become necessary, but empty double quotes can be used as a placeholder for the default value. If an optional argument is required from a dedicated server, it will be preceeded by `*`.
- Player, body, AI, item, equipment, team, elite, interactable, and director card values can be declared by either their ID, or their string name. The latter can be written in freeform and it will be matched to the first result that contains the string. See the related `list_` commands for options and which result would take precedence if there are multiple matches.

Commands:

* **next_stage** - Advance to the next stage. `next_stage [specific_stage]`. If no stage is entered, the next stage in progression is selected.
* **force_family_event** - Forces a Family Event to happen in the next stage, takes no arguments. `force_family_event`
* **next_boss** - Sets the next teleporter/simulacrum boss to the specified boss. Get a list of potential boss with `list_directorcards`. `next_boss {director_card} [count:1] [elite:None]`
* **fixed_time** - Sets the time that has progressed in the run. Affects difficulty. `fixed_time [time]`. If no time is supplied, prints the current time to console.
* **next_wave** - Advance to the next Simulacrum wave. `next_wave`
* **force_wave** - Set the next wave prefab. `force_wave [wave_prefab]`. If no input is supplied, prints all available options and clears any previous selection.
* **set_run_waves_cleared** - Set the Simulacrum waves cleared. Must be positive. `set_run_waves_cleared {wave}`
* **add_portal** - Teleporter will attempt to spawn after the teleporter completion. `add_portal {portal ('blue'|'gold'|'celestial'|'null'|'void'|'deepvoid'|'all')}`. The `null` portal doesn't require a teleporter and will spawn in front of the player.
* **seed** - Set the seed for all next runs this session. `seed [new_seed]`. Use `0` to specify the game should generate its own seed. If used without argument, it's equivalent to the vanilla `run_get_seed`.
* **kill_all** - Kills all members of a specified team. `kill_all [team:Monster]`.
* **true_kill** - Truly kill a player, ignoring revival effects. `true_kill *[player:<self>]`
* **respawn** - Respawn a player at the map spawnpoint. `respawn *[player:<self>]`
* **teleport_on_cursor** -  Teleport you to where your cursor is currently aiming at. `teleport_on_cursor`
* **time_scale** -  Sets the timescale of the game. 0.5 would mean everything happens at half speed. `time_scale [time_scale]`. If no argument is supplied, gives the current timescale.
* **post_sound_event** - Post a sound event to the AkSoundEngine (WWise) by its event name: `post_sound_event {event_name}`

List Commands:

* [All the `list_` commands support filtering](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72328339/213889205-2dbaab4f-3b88-481e-ba29-2a466a10ed53.png)

* **list_buff** - List all Buffs and if they are stackable.
* **list_dot** - List all DoT effects.
* **list_itemtier** - List all Item Tiers.
* **list_item** - List all Items, their language invariants, and if they are in the current drop pool.
* **list_equip** - List all Equipment, their language invariants, and if they are in the current drop pool.
* **list_interactables** List all Interactables.
* **list_directorcards** List all Director Cards. Mainly used for the `next_boss` command.

Dump Commands:

* **dump_buffs** - List the buffs/debuffs of all spawned bodies.
* **dump_inventories** - List the inventory items and equipment of all spawned bodies.
* **dump_state** - List the current stats, entity state, and skill cooldown of a specified body. `dump_state *[target (player|'pinged'):<self>]`
* **dump_stats** - List the base stats of a specific body.

Buff Commands:

* **give_buff** - Gives a buff to a character. Duration of 0 means permanent: `give_buff {buff} [count:1] [duration:0] *[target (player|'pinged'):<self>]`
* **give_dot** - Gives a DoT stack to a character: `give_dot {dot} [count:1] *[target (player|'pinged'):<self>] *[attacker (player|'pinged'):<self>]`
* **remove_buff** - Removes a buff from a character. Timed buffs prioritise the longest expiration stack: `remove_buff {buff} [count:1] [timed (0|1):0/false] *[target (player|'pinged'):<self>]`
* **remove_buff_stacks** - Resets a buff for a character: `remove_buff_stacks {buff} [timed (0|1):0/false] *[target (player|'pinged'):<self>]`
* **remove_all_buffs** - Resets all buffs for a character: `remove_all_buffs [timed (0|1):0/false] *[target (player|'pinged'):<self>]`
* **remove_dot** - Removes a DoT stack with the longest expiration from a character: `remove_dot {dot} [count:1] *[target (player|'pinged'):<self>]`
* **remove_dot_stacks** - Removes all stacks of a DoT effect from a character: `remove_dot_stacks {dot} *[target (player|'pinged'):<self>]`
* **remove_all_dots** - Removes all DoT effects from a character: `remove_all_dot *[target (player|'pinged'):<self>]`

***Note:*** _The game does not protect against negative buff stacks, which can lead to unintended behaviors. Gaining a timed buff gives a permanent stack which is taken away upon expiration._ `give_buff bleed 5 10; remove_buff_stacks bleed` _will lead to -5 bleed stacks when the timed buff expires. Having a DoT active is also similar to a timed buff._

Item Commands:

* **give_item** - Give an item directly to a target's inventory. A negative amount is an alias for `remove_item`: `give_item {item} [count:1] *[target (player|'pinged'|'evolution'|'simulacrum'|'voidfields'):<self>]`
* **random_items** - Generate random items from the available item tiers. `random_items {count} [droptable (droptable|'all'):'all'] *[target (player|'pinged'|'evolution'|'simulacrum'|'voidfields'):<self>]`
* **give_equip** - Give an equipment directly to a target's inventory: `give_equip {(equip|'random')} *[target (player|'pinged'|'evolution'|'simulacrum'|'voidfields'):<self>]`
* **give_money** - Gives the desired player/team money. A negative amount can remove that many without underflowing. `give_money {amount} [target ('all'|player):'all']`
* **give_lunar** - Gives the specified amount of lunar coins to the issuing player. A negative count may be specified to remove that many. `give_lunar [amount:1]`
* **remove_item** - Removes an item from a target's inventory. A negative amount is an alias for `give_item`: `remove_item {item} [count:1] *[target (player|'pinged'|'evolution'|'simulacrum'|'voidfields'):<self>]`
* **remove_item_stacks** - Removes all item stacks from a target's inventory. `remove_item_stacks {item} *[target (player|'pinged'|'evolution'|'simulacrum'|'voidfields'):<self>]`
* **remove_all_items** - Removes all items from a target's inventory. `remove_all_items *[target (player|'pinged'|'evolution'|'simulacrum'|'voidfields'):<self>]`
* **remove_equip** - Sets the equipment of a target to 'None'. `remove_equip *[target (player|'pinged'|'evolution'|'simulacrum'|'voidfields'):<self>]`
* **create_pickup** - Creates a pickup in front of a player. Pickups are items, equipment, or coins. When the pickup is an item or equipment, the search argument 'item' or 'equip' may be specified to only search that list. `create_pickup {object (item|equip|'lunarcoin'|'voidcoin')} [search ('item'|'equip'|'both'):'both'] *[player:<self>]`
* **create_potential** - Creates a potential in front of a player. The first item tier defined in the droptable decides the color of the droplet and what items will be available with the Artifact of Command. `create_potential [droptable (droptable|'all'):'all'] [count:3] *[player:<self>]`

***Note:*** Some commands support a weighted item selection, referred to as _droptable_. The syntax for it is `<itemtier:weight tokens separated by comma>`. The weight should be a positive float and is an optional argument with a default value of 1.0. If a comma or decimal point is used, the whole argument must be surrounded in double quotes. The keyword `all` uses all available item tiers with a default weight. For example, any of the following are valid inputs: `tier1`, `"tier1:5,tier2,tier3:0.4"`, `all`.

Spawn Commands:

* **spawn_interactable/spawn_interactible** - Spawns an interactible in front of the player. `(spawn_interactable|spawn_interactible) {interactable}`
* **spawn_ai** - Spawn an AI. `spawn_ai {ai} [count:1] [elite:None] [braindead (0|1):0/false] [team:Monster]`.
* **spawn_as** - Spawn as a new character. `spawn_as {body} *[player:<self>]`
* **spawn_body** - Spawns a CharacterBody with no AI, inventory, or team alliance: `spawn_body {body}`
* **change_team** - Change a player's team. `change_team {team} *[player:<self>]`.

Profile Commands:

* **prevent_profile_writing** - Prevent saving the user profile to avoid bogus data. Enable before doing something and keep it until the end of the session. `prevent_profile_writing [flag (0|1)]`. If no argument is supplied, prints the current state. Disabled by default.

Cheat Commands:

* **no_enemies** - Toggles enemy spawns.
* **god** - Toggles HealthComponent.TakeDamage for all players. AKA: you can't take damage.
